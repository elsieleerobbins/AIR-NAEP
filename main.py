However, not everyone has access to this essential resource. The digital divide refers to the gap between people who do not have access to the internet or digital devices and those that do. Students in rural areas and low-income students are disproportionately denied access to the internet for a variety of reasons. In rural areas, the infrastructure of internet cables might not not run to students\' houses. In low-income households, broadband internet might be too expensive to afford. Increasing digital equity has been a goal for many states over the years, and this effort has been galvanized by the pandemic and the need to move education to distance learning.')

But, when looking at the Household Pulse data, we see that there are varying levels of availability. Only 70% of students always have access to the internet. Grouping together all of the categories that indicate some type of access - Always, Usually, Sometimes and Rarely - we reach 97% access, on par with the NAEP data. Lower levels of availability, such as Sometimes available or Rarely available, could interfere with a students' education. Partial availability could be the result of unafforable or low bandwidth internet. Policy and funding can focus on these issues, such as the FCC's Emergency Broadband Benefit program that provides funds to low-income households to pay for broadband internet services. ")

Virginia had seven agencies, one task force, one plan, one goal, and five funds to increase access to the internet. Other top states for policy initiatives were California and Massachusettes, each with 9 initiatives. Several states did not have any policy initiatives before the pandemic: Missisippi, Texas, South Carolina, Ohio, and New Jersey. But, the pandemic galvanized efforts to increase access to internet. Many states allocated funds from the CARES Act to this cause. Missisippi allocated 275 million dollars, Texas allocated 200 million dollars, and South Carolina and Ohio both allocated 50 million dollars.')
